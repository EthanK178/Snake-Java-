# Snake-Java-

From a collection of java projects I made back in high school for fun. 

IMPORTANT NOTE: These were made using Netbeans 8.2 IDE on using JDK 8 back in 2029-2021. Other IDEs and JDK's have not been tested and may not work. These projects are quite old, so the code is not quite up to par and partially buggy, but I'm proud of them nonetheless. I've attached some demos of each project in their own project file, but feel free to try them yourself (if you have the IDE and JDK to run it)
